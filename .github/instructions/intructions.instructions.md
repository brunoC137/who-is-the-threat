üéØ Project Overview

Goal:
A mobile-first web application to record and visualize Commander (EDH) games among friends.
It allows players to register profiles, manage their decks, and track games (participants, decks used, and results).
Admins have full control over all data, while regular users can manage only their own content.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (or Next.js) + TailwindCSS + a Design System (e.g., Radix, Shadcn/UI, or Chakra UI)

Backend: Node.js + Express + Mongoose

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Hosting: Render (API) + Vercel (frontend)

Auth: JWT + bcrypt (password encryption)

Folder structure: Both frontend and backend on the same repository, on the root of the repo we will have frontend folder for the front, and a backend folder for the back

‚úÖ Functional Requirements
1. Authentication & Authorization

Email + password login with JWT-based authentication.

Admin users can:

Manage (CRUD) all entities (players, decks, games).

Regular users can:

Create and edit their own decks and games.

View all players and decks.

Edit only their own profile.

2. User Profiles

Each user has:

Name and nickname (display name).

Email and password (encrypted).

Profile picture (URL) ‚Äî optional but displayed in the UI.

isAdmin flag to grant full control.

Reference to all decks they own.

3. Deck Management

Users can add, edit, or delete their decks.

Deck fields:

Name

Commander

Decklist link (e.g., Moxfield)

Deck image (URL, optional but displayed on UI)

Color identity (optional, e.g., ["W", "U", "B"])

Tags/archetypes (optional, e.g., ["Combo", "Group Hug"])

Admins can manage any user‚Äôs decks.

4. Game Tracking

When starting a game:

Select participating players.

Select which deck each player used.

Record placements (1st, 2nd, etc.).

Optional fields:

Duration (minutes)

Notes / Highlights (string)

Admins can edit any game; regular users can edit only their own created games.

5. Statistics Dashboard

Per-player and per-deck statistics:

Games played

Wins and win rate

Favorite decks (most used)

Filters:

By player, date, or commander

Leaderboards (optional future enhancement)

6. Frontend Experience

Mobile-first layout ‚Äî responsive and touch-friendly.

Cohesive visual design:

Use of design system (suggestion: Shadcn/UI + Tailwind).

Consistent spacing, colors, and typography.

Core screens:

Dashboard (quick stats, recent games)

Players list

Deck list (with images)

Game creation form

Game history

Profile page

Simple, modern, and visually appealing ‚Äî not cluttered, but engaging.
